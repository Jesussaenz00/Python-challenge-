# Python-challenge-

In this project I analyzed two different datasets called PyBank and PyPoll.

The PyBank dataset consisted in creating a Python script that analyzes the records of a company. The Python script includes the total months that are being analized in the data set, continues with the total net value, performs an operation to obtain the average change between operations, and finally comes out with the final gratest increase and decrease between profits (These includes the date that it was detonated).

 The PyPoll dataset consisted in creating a Python script that analyzes the record votes from an ocurred election. The first variable shows the total votes accounted in the event. The Python script deploys the three voted representatives and their respected percentage of obtained votes through the election. Finally the python script shows the winner of the election.
